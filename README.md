# PowerAPI Akka version

PowerAPI Akka version is a scala-based library for monitoring energy at the process-level. It is based on a modular and asynchronous event-driven architecture using the [Akka library](http://akka.io "Akka library").

PowerAPI differs from existing energy process-level monitoring tool in its pure software, fully customizable and modular aspect which let user to precisely define what he wants to monitor, without any external device.

PowerAPI offers an API which can be use to express request about energy spent by a processus, following its hardware resource utilization (in term of CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.).

## Getting started

PowerAPI is completely written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org "Scala language") (v. 2.9.1+), using the [Akka library](http://akka.io "Akka library") (v 2.0.1+). Configuration part is managed by the [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config "Typesafe Config") (integrated version from the [Akka library](http://akka.io "Akka library")).
PowerAPI project is fully managed by [Maven](http://maven.apache.org "Maven") (v. 2/3).

### How to acquire it

To acquire PowerAPI, simply clone it via your Git client:

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/abourdon/powerapi-akka.git
```

### How to compile it

__Note that we are waiting for a Maven repository to avoid this boring compilation phase__

PowerAPI's modules are symbolized as a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org "Maven") project.
Thus, make sure that all dependencies of your desired module have been correctly satisfied:

``` bash
cd ${powerapi-akka-directory}

cd parent
mvn install

cd ../core
mvn install

(and so on)
```

### How to use it

Now you can navigate to your desired module and use it:

``` bash
cd ${powerapi-akka-directory}/sensor/sensor-cpu-api
mvn test
```

### How to configure it

As said above, configuration part is managed by the [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config "Typesafe Config"). Thus, be aware to properly configure each module from its `.conf` file(s).

Let's take an example for the `fr.inria.powerapi.formula.formula-cpu-general` module, which implements the PowerAPI CPU `Formula` in using the well-known formula, `P = c * f * V * V`, where `c` constant, `f` a frequency and `V` its associated voltage.

To compute this formula, `fr.inria.powerapi.formula.formula-cpu-general` module has to know:
* the CPU _Thermal Dissipation Power_ value;
* the array of frequency/voltage used by the CPU

These information can be written in the associated configuration file as the following:
```
powerapi {
	cpu {
		tdp = 105
		frequencies = [
			{ value = 1800002, voltage = 1.31 }
			{ value = 2100002, voltage = 1.41 }
			{ value = 2400003, voltage = 1.5 }
		]
	}
}
```

Each module can have its own configuration part. See more details in the associated README file.

## Architecture details

PowerAPI is based on a modular and asynchronous event-driven architecture using the [Akka library](http://akka.io "Akka library"). Architecture is centralized around a common event bus where each module can publish/subscribe to emitted events. One particularity of this architecture is that each module is in passive state and reacts to event emitted by the common event bus.

These modules are organized as follow:

### Core

As its name indicates, `Core` module gather all *kernel* functionnalities that will be use by other modules. More particulary, this module defines the whole types used by PowerAPI to define its architecture.

This module also defines the essential `Clock` class, responsible of the periodically emission of the `Tick` message, itself responsible of the process of the PowerAPI business part.

### Sensors

To compute the energy spent by a process through its hardware resource utilization, PowerAPI cutting computation in two parts:
1. Monitor hardware resource process utilization;
2. Compute the energy implies by the hardware resource process utilization.

Sensors is thus a set of `Sensor`, responsible of the monitoring of hardware resource process utilization. Thus, you have a CPU `Sensor`, a memory `Sensor`, a disk `Sensor` and so on.
As these information are given by operating system, there is one `Sensor` implementation by operating system type. Thus you may have a CPU Linux `Sensor`, a CPU Windows `Sensor`, and so on.

### Formulae

Set of `Formula`, responsible of the computation of the energy spent by a process on a particular hardware resource (e.g CPU, memory, disk or network), following information provided by its associated `Sensor`.
A `Formula` may depend on the type of the monitorded hardware resource. Thus, for the same hardware resource, several `Formula` implementations are possible.

### Listeners

Set of `Listener`, that listen `Formula` events emitted by the common event bus. Thus, a `Listener` define the actions to do when receiving results from the energy computation (e.g display information, produce and submit a new information in the common event bus, etc.). 

### Library

The Library module defines the API that can be use by user to interact with PowerAPI.

## API details

Process-level energy monitoring is based on a periodically computation that can be expressed via the API. Here there are several examples to describes PowerAPI's API:

### What is the CPU energy spent by the 123 process? Please give me fresh results every 500 milliseconds

Considering that process run under Linux, using a procfs file system on a *standard* CPU architecture.
Thus, we need to use the procfs CPU `Sensor` implementation and the general CPU `Formula` implementation. Add to this the desire to display CPU energy spent by process into the console. So we need to:

1. Activate desired modules:

``` scala
Array(
    classOf[fr.inria.powerapi.sensor.proc.CpuSensor],
    classOf[fr.inria.powerapi.formula.general.CpuFormula]
).foreach(PowerAPI.startEnergyModule(_))
```

2. Request to PowerAPI system the CPU energy spent by the 123 process, every 500 milliseconds:

``` scala
PowerAPI.startMonitoring(
    Process(123),
    500 milliseconds,
    classOf[fr.inria.powerapi.listener.console.CpuListener]
)
```

### Based on the first request, how can I display CPU energy information into a chart too?

Based on the previous code, we simply have to add a new `Listener` that is able to display CPU energy information into a chart.
PowerAPI integrates a `Listener` using the [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart "JFreeChart") implementation. So let's add it to the PowerAPI system:

``` scala
PowerAPI.startMonitoring(
    listener = classOf[fr.inria.powerapi.listener.jfreechart.CpuListener]
)
```

That's all!

## Future works

We are working on new hardware resource *energy modules* (`Sensor` + `Formula`) development. If you are interested to participate, feel free to contact powerapi-user-list@googlegroups.com!
