 * Clock component, that "tick" the event bus following a configured period.

 * The PowerAPI architecture is based on a asynchronous architecture composed by several components.
 * Each component listen to an event bus and reacts following messages sent by the event bus.
 * Thus, each component is in a passive state and only run its business part following the sent message.
 *
 * At the bottom of this architecture, the Clock component provides a "tick" message to wake up
 * components which are listen to it.
 *
 * Clock component reacts to both TickIt and UnTickIt messages which respectively ask to
 * start/stop a periodically sending of a Tick message.
