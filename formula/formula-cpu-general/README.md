# General implementation for the PowerAPI CPU Formula module

Implements PowerAPI CPU `Formula` module in weighting each frequency by the time spent by CPU in working under it.

Global CPU energy computation is based on the general well-known formula: P = c * f * V * V where c constant, f a frequency and V its associated voltage.
